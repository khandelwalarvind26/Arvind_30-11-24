Store Hours:
10:00:00 - 21:30:00

First Status query at:
10:30:00 - Active or inactive : Mark 10 - 10:30 as whatever that status query is 

Basic crux - for an inactive query take +/- 5 minutes as inactive
for consecutive inactive queries take entire time as inactive
for consecutive active queries simple logic

10:45 +/- 5 minutes of that query as inactive, 10:46 active then change uptime/downtime
minutes offset can be easily modified by DOWNTIME_OFFSET in .env

4 cases:
previous_query, current_query
        active, active  -> Mark entire time between as active
                          eg query at 10 and 11 both active then minutes between 10 and 11 active

        active, inactive -> mark time from last query till 5 minutes before current_query as active 
                            last 5 minutes from current_query as inactive
                            eg query at 10:30 active but at 11 inactive -> mark 10:30 - 10:55 as active, 10:55 - 11 as inactive

      inactive, active -> mark 5 minutes from last_query as inactive
                          from the 5 minutes timestamp to current_time as active
                          eg query at 10:30 inactive but at 11 active -> mark 10:30 - 10:35 as inactive, 10:35 - 11 as active 

      inactive, inactive -> mark time between as inactive


Last status query at:
20:30:00 - Active or inactive : Mark entire 20:30 -> 21:30 as whatever status
